To use the package, download (or clone) and:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd Wiggum/
  pip install .

To use the package in python, after installed:

.. code-block:: Python

  import wiggum as wg

Installing makes the flask app for interactive vizualization
in browser available as a command line tool. To run the app:

.. code-block:: bash

  wiggum-app



Development
============

To compile docs, sphinx and some extensions are required, all are included in
`requirements.txt` and can be installed with

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install -r requirements.txt

then

.. code-block:: bash

  cd docs/
  make html


To reinstall after changes

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install --upgrade .

When updating the package and working in a notebook, the notebook's kernel will
need to be restarted to get the updates, if they're done outside of the notebook.

(only needed in development or after upgrade)
